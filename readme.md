Simulating the law of gravitational attraction with ManimCE in python.

How to use:
1. Install manim: run 'pip install manim' in the terminal
2. Run the application:
   - If you want high quality 1080p 60fps video then run: 'manim main.py' in the terminal
   - If you want a low quality 480p 15fps video then run: 'manim -ql main.py' in the terminal

Use cases:
- A good way to visually explain the law of gravitational attraction.

Known issues:
- When the balls boune off each other they retain their parabula path that they were going to take
  instead of bouncing in the direction that the balls hit each other
